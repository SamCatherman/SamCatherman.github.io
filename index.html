          A creative, passionate developer with a focus on providing intuitive
          solutions to real-world problems. Driven by curiosity and a strong
          sense of purpose, with a desire to leave the world a better place than
          when I arrived. Continuously seeking new knowledge to improve designs
          and create value for forward-thinking organizations.

          In 2016, I left my job as a writer behind to pursue a career in web
          development. I began building sites and web components for private and
          commercial clients in 2017. I enjoy developing with
          Ruby on Rails, React, the MEAN Stack, and strive to always be learning
          new technologies. Please find some examples of my work below.
